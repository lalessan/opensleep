    <div class="section-title">Why Baby Sleep is Still a Mystery</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p> My name is Laura Alessandretti and I work as Associate Professor in Behavioural Data Science.  </p> 
        <p> When I had my daughter Luna, I became obsessed with baby sleep. </p>
        <p>Like many parents, I read books, scrolled through Reddit threads, and tried to make sense of all the conflicting advice.</p>

        <p>I just wanted answers: <i>Is my baby sleeping enough? Too much? Are all these night wakes normal?</i></p>

        <p>One day, when Luna was six months old, I looked up how much daytime sleep she should be getting.</p>

        <p>Here‚Äôs what I found:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Huckleberry: <i>2.5‚Äì3.5 hours</i> 
                (<a href="https://huckleberrycare.com/blog/baby-sleep-schedule-by-age-nap-and-sleep-chart" target="_blank">source</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Napper: <i>4 hours</i> 
                (<a href="https://napper.app/en/blog/baby-sleep/sleep-and-wake-phases-table-overview-and-tips/" target="_blank">source</a>)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Both seemed reasonable. But why the difference?</p>

        <p>I thought there must be a large study showing how much babies actually sleep at different ages‚Äîjust like the charts doctors use for height and weight. But after searching, I found nothing. No real numbers, just expert opinions and small studies.</p>

        <p>And I wasn‚Äôt alone. Every parenting forum I visited was full of parents asking the same questions:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><i>"My baby is five months old and only naps two hours a day‚Äîis that normal?"</i></p>
            <p><i>"How much should a seven-month-old sleep at night?"</i></p>
            <p><i>"My nine-month-old wakes up four times a night‚Äîis anyone else dealing with this?"</i></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>That‚Äôs when it hit me: <a href=https://explore.huckleberrycare.com/app//>Millions of parents track their baby‚Äôs sleep.</a> <b>Why isn‚Äôt this data just shown somewhere?</b></p>
    </div>

<section class="scroll-section">
    <div class="section-title">Don‚Äôt Sleep Apps Already Have This Data?</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>Yes, but they don‚Äôt share it with us.</p>

        <p>Apps like Huckleberry and Napper collect large amounts of baby sleep data, but parents don‚Äôt get to see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real distributions of baby sleep across different ages</li>
            <li>Comparisons to other babies in a similar stage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We can do better. What if this data wasn‚Äôt just used behind the scenes, but was open and available to help all parents?</p>

    <div class="section-title">What We Can Build Together</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>If you‚Äôre here, you‚Äôre probably part of an online community of parents who swap advice, share experiences, and try to figure out baby sleep together.</p>

        <p>What if we pooled our data to build something useful for everyone?</p>

        <p>As a researcher in behavioral data science, I‚Äôve designed the OpenSleep data collection to uncover real patterns in baby sleep. I‚Äôm inviting every parent who tracks sleep to contribute. </p>
        <p>When we reach 1,000 contributors, I‚Äôll compile and share:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>An open dataset that parents, researchers, and doctors can access</li>
            <li>A free online tool where you can compare your baby‚Äôs sleep to a large sample of real babies</li>
        </ul>
