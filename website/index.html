            <p>If you track your baby’s sleep, you can contribute to a community-driven effort 
                to make baby sleep data available to all parents. By sharing your data, 
                you help build an open tool and support research that benefits families everywhere.</p>

    <div class="section-title">Why Baby Sleep is Still a Mystery</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>When I had my daughter Luna, I became obsessed with baby sleep. </p>
        <p>Like many parents, I read books, scrolled through Reddit threads, and tried to make sense of all the conflicting advice.</p>

        <p>I just wanted answers: <i>Is my baby sleeping enough? Too much? Are all these night wakes normal?</i></p>

        <p>One day, when Luna was six months old, I looked up how much daytime sleep she should be getting.</p>

        <p>Here’s what I found:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Huckleberry: <i>2.5–3.5 hours</i> 
                (<a href="https://huckleberrycare.com/blog/baby-sleep-schedule-by-age-nap-and-sleep-chart" target="_blank">source</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Napper: <i>4 hours</i> 
                (<a href="https://napper.app/en/blog/baby-sleep/sleep-and-wake-phases-table-overview-and-tips/" target="_blank">source</a>)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Both seemed reasonable. But why the difference?</p>

        <p>I thought there must be a large study showing how much babies actually sleep at different ages—just like the charts doctors use for height and weight. But after searching, I found nothing. No real numbers, just expert opinions and small studies.</p>

        <p>And I wasn’t alone. Every parenting forum I visited was full of parents asking the same questions:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><i>"My baby is five months old and only naps two hours a day—is that normal?"</i></p>
            <p><i>"How much should a seven-month-old sleep at night?"</i></p>
            <p><i>"My nine-month-old wakes up four times a night—is anyone else dealing with this?"</i></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>That’s when it hit me: <a href=https://explore.huckleberrycare.com/app//>Millions of parents track their baby’s sleep.</a> <b>Why isn’t this data just shown somewhere?</b></p>

<section class="scroll-section">
    <div class="section-title">Don’t Sleep Apps Already Have This Data?</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>Yes, but they don’t share it with us.</p>

        <p>Apps like Huckleberry and Napper collect large amounts of baby sleep data, but parents don’t get to see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real distributions of baby sleep across different ages</li>
            <li>Comparisons to other babies in a similar stage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We can do better. What if this data wasn’t just used behind the scenes, but was open and available to help all parents?</p>

    <div class="section-title">What We Can Build Together</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>If you’re here, you’re probably part of an online community of parents who swap advice, share experiences, and try to figure out baby sleep together.</p>

        <p>What if we pooled our data to build something useful for everyone?</p>

        <p>This is exactly what OpenSleep is about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An open dataset that parents, researchers, and doctors can access</li>
            <li>A free online tool where you can compare your baby’s sleep to a large sample of real babies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When we reach 1,000 contributors, I’ll compile and share a de-deintifed dataset of baby sleep and an online tool for everyone to use.</p>

    <div class="section-title">How I Handle Privacy</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>I know that sharing data is a big decision, and I want to be completely transparent about how this works.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The data I collect comes only from tracking apps. I don’t collect personal details like names or emails.</li>
            <li>Everything follows GDPR standards.</li>
            <li>Before re-sharing the data openely, I will harmonize the data and apply additional privacy protections. This includes removing precise timestamps to make sure the dataset remains privacy-preserving while still useful for research.</li>
            <li>Your data will only not be used for commercial purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You remain in control. You’ll receive a clear terms and conditions document outlining everything.</p>

    <div class="section-content">
        <p>I’m Laura Alessandretti, an Associate Professor in Modelling Human Behaviour at the Computer Science department of the Technical University of Denmark.</p>

        <p>My research focuses on large-scale digital data—I’ve studied how people move, interact online, and make decisions. My work has been published in journals like Nature, Science Advances, and Nature Human Behaviour.</p>

        <p>Originally from Italy, I’ve lived in Denmark for many years. Last August, my first daughter, Luna, was born. She’s a great sleeper—most of the time. Like all babies, she has her ups and downs.</p>
