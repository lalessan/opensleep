    <div class="section-title">Why Baby Sleep is Still a Mystery</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>One day, when Luna was six months old, her nightsleep went crap.
            </p>

        <p>How could I help her? How much daytime sleep she should be getting? Like many parents, I read books, scrolled through Reddit threads, and tried to make sense of all the conflicting advice.
            Here’s what I found:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Huckleberry: <i>2.5–3.5 hours</i>
                (<a href="https://huckleberrycare.com/blog/baby-sleep-schedule-by-age-nap-and-sleep-chart" target="_blank">source</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Napper: <i>4 hours</i>
                (<a href="https://napper.app/en/blog/baby-sleep/sleep-and-wake-phases-table-overview-and-tips/" target="_blank">source</a>)
            </li>
            <li>Taking cara babies: <i>3-4 hours</i>
                (<a href="https://takingcarababies.com/nap-schedules?srsltid=AfmBOornhYkuPgGhvQmU0Zf-4ypsgssdUESsPtnJWJGehuZ5_ublTerA" target="_blank">source</a>)
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>All seemed reasonable. But why the difference?</p>

        <p>I would have liked to know how many babies sleep 2 hours and how many sleep 4 hours and what correlates with night time sleep</p>

        <p>
            I have soon realized that these numbers I thought there must be a large study showing how much babies actually sleep at different ages, right? just like the charts doctors use for height and weight.
            But after searching, I found nothing. <b>No real numbers, just people and expert opinions</b> and small studies.</p>

        <p>I just wanted answers: <i>Is my baby sleeping enough? Too much? Are all these night wakes normal?</i></p>

        <div class="section-title">I am not alone</div>
        <div class="section-content">


            <p> When I had my daughter Luna, I became obsessed with baby sleep. </p>
            <p>Like many parents, I asked advices to my friends, I read books (e.g. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/preciouslittlesleep/?locale=en_GB">a great one</a>!), scrolled through sub-Reddits (e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/">this one</a>), and tried to make sense of all the conflicting advice.</p>

            <p>I wasn’t alone, and you are not alone &#128514;. Every parenting forum I visited was full of parents asking the same questions:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><i>"My baby is five months old and only naps two hours a day—is that normal?"</i></p>
                <p><i>"How much should a seven-month-old sleep at night?"</i></p>
                <p><i>"My nine-month-old wakes up four times a night—is anyone else dealing with this?"</i></p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>That’s when it hit me: <a href=https://explore.huckleberrycare.com/app//>Millions of parents track their baby’s sleep.</a></p>
            <p><b>Why isn’t this data just shown somewhere?</b></p>

    <div class="section-content">
        <p>Yes, but <b>they keep it from themselves don’t share it with us</b>.</p>

        <p>Apps like Huckleberry and Napper collect large amounts of baby sleep data, but parents don’t get to see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Real distributions of baby sleep across different ages</li>
            <li>Comparisons to other babies in a similar stage (e.g. 70% of babies behave [like this..])</li>

        <p>If you’re here, you’re probably part of an online community of parents who swap advice, share experiences, and try to figure out baby sleep together.</p>

        <p>What if we pooled our data to build something <b>useful for everyone?</b></p>

        <p>As a researcher in behavioral data science, I’ve designed the OpenSleep data collection to uncover real patterns in baby sleep. I’m inviting every parent who tracks sleep to contribute. </p>
        <p>When we reach 1,000 contributors, I’ll compile and share:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>An <b>open (for everyone) dataset</b> that <b>parents, researchers, and doctors can use and access!</b></li>
            <li>A free online tool where you can compare your baby’s sleep to a large sample of real babies</li>
