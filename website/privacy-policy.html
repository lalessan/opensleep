        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to OpenSleep, a research project aimed at understanding baby sleep patterns through crowdsourced data from parents. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your and your baby’s data when you participate in the OpenSleep study.</p>
        <p>By using our platform and sharing your data, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>OpenSleep is a research initiative led by <strong>Laura Alessandretti</strong>. Our research is conducted in compliance with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> and relevant data protection laws that apply to the processing of personal data in research.</p>
        
        <h2>3. What Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Baby Sleep Data:</strong> Behavioral data collected from tracking apps, including sequences of sleep and feeding patterns over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Baby Information:</strong> Baby’s birthday and responses provided by the parent regarding feeding and sleep habits through a short questionnaire.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental Information:</strong> Parent’s email address (for communication and compliance with GDPR data deletion rights) and country (extracted from the IP address but not stored).</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We do not collect IP addresses. However, limited metadata related to form submissions may be recorded by Tally for security and debugging purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. How We Collect Your Data</h2>
        <p>We collect your data through <strong>Tally</strong>, a GDPR-compliant online form platform. When you submit data via Tally:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your responses are securely stored on Tally’s servers within the <strong>European Union (EU)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Tally acts as a <strong>data processor</strong> on our behalf, meaning it does not use or share your data beyond storage and processing.</li>
            <li>We ensure that Tally’s processing complies with GDPR and have a <strong>Data Processing Agreement (DPA)</strong> in place.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scientific Research:</strong> Analyzing baby sleep patterns for publication in scientific journals and conferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Data Sharing:</strong> Creating an anonymized dataset that will be published in open-access repositories.</li>
            <li><strong>Parent-Facing Interactive Tool:</strong> Developing a tool that allows parents to compare their baby’s sleep to aggregated data from the OpenSleep project.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. How We Protect Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each participant is assigned a <strong>randomly generated ID</strong> to replace personal identifiers.</li>
            <li>Personal identifiers (such as names and emails) are stored securely and separately from sleep data.</li>
            <li>Before sharing the dataset, we <strong>de-identify</strong> the data by:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Removing actual timestamps and birthdays</strong> (replacing them with "time since birth").</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregating data by day</strong> rather than sharing raw individual records.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Only authorized researchers will have access to identifiable data for processing and anonymization.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. Who Can Access Your Data?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The OpenSleep research team has access to identifiable data for processing and anonymization.</li>
            <li>De-identified data (with personal identifiers removed) may be shared with other academic researchers and included in public research repositories.</li>
            <li>No raw, identifiable data will ever be disclosed to third parties outside the research team.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifiable data (such as email and country) will be stored for a maximum of <strong>[X months/years]</strong> after participation or until you request deletion.</li>
            <li>De-identified sleep data may be retained indefinitely for research purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>9. Your Rights as a Participant</h2>
