        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>You are invited to participate in the OpenSleep project, a research study aimed at understanding infant sleep patterns through data contributed by parents. Your participation is entirely voluntary. This document provides information about the study, how your and your baby’s data will be used, and your rights as a participant. Please read it carefully before deciding whether to take part. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at [Your Contact Email].</p>

        <h2>2. Purpose of the Study</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to collect and analyze real-world infant sleep data to improve scientific understanding of baby sleep patterns. We aim to create an open-access dataset that can benefit parents, researchers, and healthcare professionals.</p>

        <h2>3. What Data Will Be Collected?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Baby Sleep Data:</strong> This is behavioral data collected from tracking apps. It includes sequences of sleep, feeding and other infant behavioural patterns over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Baby Information:</strong> We collect the baby’s birthday and additional information provided by the parent on their baby’s feeding and sleep habits through answers to a short questionnaire.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental Information:</strong> We collect the parent's email address (for communication and to warrant the right to be deleted in compliance with GDPR) and country (extracted from the IP address).</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> No IP addresses are stored, but basic technical metadata may be collected for security and debugging purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How Will My Data Be Used?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fueling scientific publications based on the analysis of baby sleep patterns.</li>
            <li>Creating an anonymized dataset that will be published in open-access repositories.</li>
            <li>Developing an interactive tool to help parents compare their baby’s sleep patterns to aggregated data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your data will <strong>never</strong> be sold, used for marketing, or shared with commercial entities.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Protection and Anonymization</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each participant will be assigned a unique, randomly generated ID.</li>
            <li>Personal identifiers (such as names or emails) will be separated from the sleep data and stored securely.</li>
            <li>The dataset will be de-identified before sharing by <strong>removing actual timestamps and birthdays</strong>. Instead of using exact time, we will store and share only the <strong>time since birth</strong> to ensure privacy.</li>
            <li>We will not share actual raw data but instead provide <strong>aggregated data by day</strong>, reducing the risk of re-identification while maintaining scientific utility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Who Will Have Access to My Data?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The research team will have access to identifiable data for processing and anonymization.</li>
            <li>De-identified data may be shared with other academic researchers and included in public research repositories.</li>
            <li>Your raw, identifiable data will never be disclosed to third parties outside of the research team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Is Participation Voluntary?</h2>
        <p>Yes. Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you are free to withdraw at any time without any consequences. If you choose to withdraw, you can request the deletion of your identifiable data by contacting us at [Your Contact Email]. However, de-identified data that has already been used in research may not be removed.</p>

        <h2>8. How Long Will My Data Be Retained?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifiable data (email, country) will be stored for a maximum of <strong>[X months/years]</strong> after participation or until you request deletion.</li>
            <li>De-identified sleep data may be retained indefinitely for research purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Legal Basis for Processing Your Data</h2>
        <p>This study complies with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>. The legal basis for processing your data is <strong>your explicit consent</strong> (Article 6(1)(a) and, where applicable, Article 9(2)(a) of GDPR).
