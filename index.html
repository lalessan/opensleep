            Why I Started OpenSleep

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>My daughter Luna slept well—until six months. Suddenly, she was waking up multiple times a night, and getting her back to sleep was a struggle.</p>
    
            <p>Like many exhausted parents, I searched everywhere—books, Facebook groups, Reddit, baby sleep websites. One common theme? Daytime sleep affects night wakings. So, I tried to find out how much she should nap at 6 months old.</p>
    
            <p>That’s when I hit a wall. Even trusted sources didn’t agree:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Huckleberry: <i>2.5–3.5 hours</i> (<a href="https://huckleberrycare.com/blog/baby-sleep-schedule-by-age-nap-and-sleep-chart" target="_blank">source</a>)</li>
                <li>Napper: <i>4 hours</i> (<a href="https://napper.app/en/blog/baby-sleep/sleep-and-wake-phases-table-overview-and-tips/" target="_blank">source</a>)</li>
                <li>Taking Cara Babies: <i>3–4 hours</i> (<a href="https://takingcarababies.com/nap-schedules?srsltid=AfmBOornhYkuPgGhvQmU0Zf-4ypsgssdUESsPtnJWJGehuZ5_ublTerA" target="_blank">source</a>)</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>Okay… but what’s the reality? How many babies nap 2.5 hours? How many nap 4? And what about those unicorn babies who sleep through the night—how much do <i>they</i> actually nap?</p>
    
            <p>I thought there would be something like growth charts, but for baby sleep—-based on real-world data.</p>
    
            <p>Instead, I found small studies and expert opinions. No clear distributions based on representative data.</p>
    
            <p>And beyond that, I wanted to see patterns. Are longer/shorter naps associated to more night wakings? I couldn’t find answers—because <b>the data simply isn’t out there.</b></p>
            <p>That’s when it hit me: <a href=https://explore.huckleberrycare.com/app//>Millions of parents track their baby’s sleep.</a></p>
            <p><b>Why isn’t this data just shown somewhere?</b></p>

            <p>Yes—but <b>they keep it to themselves</b>.</p>
    
            <p>Apps like Huckleberry and Napper collect huge amounts of baby sleep data, but parents never get to see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How real babies sleep across different ages</li>
                <li>How your baby’s sleep compares to others</li>
                <li>Patterns—like how the length of naps relates with night wakings</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>We track our babies' sleep. Shouldn’t we have access to the big picture?</p>

        <p>If you’re here, you’re probably part of an online community of parents who swap advice, share experiences, and try to figure out baby sleep together.</p>

        <p>What if we pooled our data to build something <b>useful for everyone?</b></p>

        <p>I’ve designed the OpenSleep data collection to uncover real patterns in baby sleep. I’m inviting every parent who tracks sleep to contribute. </p>
        <p>When we reach 1,000 contributors, I’ll compile and share:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>An open dataset</b> that parents, researchers, and doctors can access and use.</li>
            <li>A <b>free online tool</b> where you can compare your baby’s sleep to a large sample of other babies.</li>
            <li>New <b>scientific research</b> that helps us understand baby sleep like never before.</li>
        </ul>
